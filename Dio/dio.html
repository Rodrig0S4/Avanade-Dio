                <p class="post-content">A expressão Lorem ipsum em design gráfico e editoração é um texto padrão em latim utilizado na
                    produção
                    gráfica para preencher os espaços de texto em publicações para testar e ajustar aspectos visuais
                    antes de
                    utilizar conteúdo real. <a href="https://github.com/Rodrig0S4" target="_blanck">GitHub</a>

                    What is Lorem Ipsum?
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and
                    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                    leap into
                    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                    release of
                    Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                    like
                    Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                    Why do we use it?
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                    when
                    looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                    distribution of
                    letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
                    Many
                    desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
                    and a
                    search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
                    evolved
                    over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
